## 1. Pudding Theme

The Visual Studio Code *Pudding Theme* currently comes in two colorways, a Light Theme and a Dark Theme.

## 2. Color Scheme

### 2.1 Color

The color scheme of this theme comes from the original cartoon character, **Pudding**. The colors in the painted image of Pudding were extracted and then used to develop this pudding theme.

Since this color scheme was originally intended for painting, there may be some problems with inappropriate colors when applied to program themes such as Visual Studio Code, and subsequent updates will be made to optimize and adjust the best style of the theme.

### 2.2 Suggestion

*Choosing a light theme during the day, and a dark theme at night* is not a good choice.

The choice between light and dark themes does not depend on whether it is day or night, **but on the intensity of light in your current environment**. 

Even at night, if you are in a bright environment, it is still recommended that you use a light color theme. Because in a bright environment, using a dark theme, your eyes will keep adjusting between the two brightnesses, which will easily cause eye fatigue.

## 3. Install

1. Go to [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bitcookies.pudding-vscode-theme).
2. Click on the "Install" button.
3. Then [select a theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_selecting-the-color-theme). Currently the following themes are available:

   + `Pudding Light`

   - `Pudding Dark`

With the update of the pudding clothing stand, the future will launch more thematic color scheme.

## 4. Feedback

The theme of the color scheme must still have a lot of shortcomings, if possible, you can give some feedback and comments here. Or, your favorite clothing apparel and colors, you can make suggestions for feedback:

- [Github Issues](https://github.com/bitcookies/pudding-vscode-theme/issues)
- [VS Market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bitcookies.pudding-vscode-theme&ssr=false#review-details)

In the future I will also paint more characters clothing style, with the update of the pudding clothing stand, the future will launch more thematic color scheme.
